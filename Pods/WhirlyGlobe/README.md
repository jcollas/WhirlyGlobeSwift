What is WhirlyGlobe-Maply?
---

WhirlyGlobe-Maply is a toolkit with two parts, hence the dash.  The WhirlyGlobe part is an interactive 3D globe.    The Maply part is an interactive 2D map.  There are separate view controllers (on iOS) for each, but otherwise they share 95% of their code.

This toolkit is used in quite a few big, complicated apps and even more smaller, less complicated apps.  Feel free to use it in yours.

WhirlyGlobe-Maply is available for iOS and Android.  The iOS version is stable and well tested.  The Android version is still in beta in the develop_3_0 branch.

This is the master branch of the WhirlyGlobe-Maply Component and API version 2.3.  It should be easy to compile, as all the crazy dependencies are in submodules.  You can also get a precompiled version.  Check the project page for that.

There’s a tutorial on [getting started](http://mousebird.github.io/WhirlyGlobe/tutorial/building_from_source.html) with WhirlyGlobe-Maply from github.  If you’re in a hurry, here’s the capsule version.

WhirlyGlobe-Maply uses a bunch of submodules, which you'll need to get.  Like so.

- git submodule init
- git submodule update

Get comfortable.  The data is contained in a submodule and it's large.

Once you get all this synced, try to build WhirlyGlobeComponentTester.  If it builds, you're good to go.  Enjoy.
